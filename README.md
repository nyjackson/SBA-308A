# SBA-308A: JavaScript Web Application #
Tarotific - A Tarot Card Dictionary Application

All card names, descriptions, and divinatory meanings from TarotAPI and the images attained from Krates98's TarotCard API repo are according to AE Waite's "Pictorial Key to the Tarot" (1910), the companion to the Rider-Waite-Smith (RWS) deck in which most newer decks are based upon.
